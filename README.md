# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service) based on historical customer data. It uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset and applies machine learning techniques to build an accurate and explainable model.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To build a machine learning model that can classify whether a customer will churn based on various features like tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and services subscribed.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Random Forest Classifier

---

## 🔍 Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding
3. **Feature Scaling**
4. **Train-Test Split**
5. **Model Training** using RandomForestClassifier
6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score
7. **Feature Importance Visualization**

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Top features identified: `MonthlyCharges`, `tenure`, `Contract_Two year`, etc.

## 📈 Sample Code Snippet

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```
